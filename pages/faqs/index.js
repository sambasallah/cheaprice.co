            <p>Our data is constantly updating, and usually current. However, p
                rice fluctuations happen constantly, and thus our listed price can theoretically sometimes 
                be behind a little bit. It is 
                thus always wise to double-check the price on Amazon, eBay or Walmart before you actually finalize the purchase.</p>

            <h2>How often does your data update?</h2>
            <p>The update frequency varies, depending on the general interest in the product in question. 
                If a product is being tracked by someone, 
                it will be updated at least once every 30 minutes. Most others are updated several times daily.</p>
            <h2>How often will be you alerted about price drops</h2>
            <p>
                You will be sent an email everytime the price of the product you are tracking is reduced
                and if the price is equal or goes below your desired price drop amount.
